# <Week 2 Challenge - My Portfolio>

## Description

I have created a portfolio website from scratch to showcase my skills and to better market myself. I included some key points to my website such as an "About Me", "Works", and a "Contact Me" section. This will allow recruiters and future employers to get a quick introduction to who I am, view my recent projects I've worked on, and different ways to reach me. I got to demonstrate my current understanding of HTML and CSS and apply it to web development through this project.
